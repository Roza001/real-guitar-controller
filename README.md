# Real Guitar as a Game Controller. 

This script identifies notes played on a real guitar heard through microphone input (I use the Rocksmith RealTune cable) and converts them into keyboard button presses.

This was created with Clone Hero in mind (I was waiting for replacement switches to my GH guitar) thus, the script is programmed with this game in mind, however, there is a list of notes left commented to make any edits easy.

Currently the controls are:

| Key  | Note | In game function|
| ------------- | ------------- |------------ |
| q  | E2  | strum up |
| a | F2 | green |
| s  | G2  | red |
| d | B2| yellow|
| f | C3  | blue |
| g  | E3 | orange |

However due to the delay it is impossible to play Clone Hero. Scirpt might be fun to try on slower games, maybe Minecraft or Among us?
